{"name":"Libstempo","tagline":"libstempo — a Python wrapper for tempo2","body":"# libstempo — a Python wrapper for tempo2 #\r\n\r\n## Installation notes ##\r\n\r\n* `libstempo` requires Python 2.7+ (but is currently untested with Python 3), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [Cython](http://www.cython.org/) (v > 0.19), and of course [tempo2](http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/tempo2/) (v 2013.9.1 or greater).\r\n* If you don't need to look at or modify the sources, you should be able to do simply `pip install libstempo`, and everything will happen for you.\r\n* Otherwise, to install `libstempo` do `python setup.py install --prefix=...` (wherever you normally install). The installer will look in likely places for the `tempo2` headers and libraries, but you can also give it the installation directory using `--with-tempo2=...` (the installation directory would be `XXX` if `tempo2.h` is installed to `XXX/include`).\r\n* If the standard installation does not work, there's a `Makefile` (written for OS X) that you could try.\r\n\r\n## Documentation ##\r\n\r\nFor the moment, _in lieu_ of documentation, have a look at this [tutorial](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/vallis/mc3pta/master/libstempo/libstempo-demo.ipynb) (an [iPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), visualized thanks to the [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/) service).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
